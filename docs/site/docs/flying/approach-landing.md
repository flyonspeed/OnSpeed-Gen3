# Approach and Landing

OnSpeed's primary value is during the approach and landing phase — the most dangerous part of every flight.

## Standard Approach

1. **Configure for landing** — set your flaps as desired for the approach
2. **Slow to approach speed** — reduce power and let the aircraft decelerate
3. **Listen for the solid tone** — when you hear the steady low tone, you're on speed
4. **Maintain the solid tone** — use small power and pitch adjustments to keep it solid
5. **Start the flare** — as you round out over the runway, the tone will begin pulsing (you're decelerating)
6. **Touch down** — tones fade as airspeed drops below the mute threshold

The key technique: **fly the tone, not the airspeed indicator**. The tone automatically adjusts for weight and G-loading.

## Short Field Approach

For a shorter approach:

- Fly to the **slow end** of the on-speed band — let the tone just barely begin high-pitched pulsing, then add a touch of power to bring it back to solid
- This gives you the minimum approach speed while maintaining a safe margin from stall
- Use steeper approach angle and less float in the flare

!!! warning "Don't push below on-speed"
    The high-pitched pulsing tone means you're below the target speed. The closer you fly to the stall warning, the less margin you have for gusts, sink, or a sudden need to maneuver.

## Gusty Conditions

In gusty or turbulent conditions:

- Fly to the **fast end** of the on-speed band — where the low pulse is just transitioning to the solid tone
- This gives you additional energy and margin for gusts
- Accept the slightly higher approach speed; it's trading off landing distance for safety

The tone fluctuation in turbulence gives you real-time feedback about AOA excursions. If the tone briefly jumps to high pitch, a gust just pushed you closer to stall — maintain (or add) power.

## Base-to-Final Turn

The base-to-final turn is where the most stall/spin accidents occur. OnSpeed provides critical awareness here:

- **In the turn**, your stall speed increases due to load factor
- **The AOA tone automatically compensates** — if you maintain the solid tone through the turn, you're at a safe AOA regardless of bank angle
- **If the tone goes high in the turn** — you're pulling too hard or too slow. Reduce bank angle and/or add power.

This is fundamentally better than watching airspeed, because the airspeed indicator doesn't tell you how much margin you have at different bank angles.

## Steep Turns

In steep turns (45°+ bank):

- Load factor is 1.4G or more
- Stall speed increases by ~20%
- The AOA tone accounts for this automatically
- If you hear the solid tone at 45° bank, you're at the same AOA margin from stall as you would be wings-level

## Best Glide

The transition from silence to the first low pulse corresponds to the **L/Dmax AOA** — your best lift-to-drag ratio. In an engine-out scenario:

- Fly to the boundary between silence and the first low pulse
- That's your best glide angle of attack
- Maintain this while you set up for an emergency landing

The tone doesn't change with weight — at any weight, the best-glide AOA is the same, even though the best-glide *speed* changes.
